# Btcie
Process to monitor Bitcoin (and other crypto) prices and notify of buy/sell signals from certain indicators, such as bollinger bands and price momentum.

Also it is generally confusing to track altcoin prices in both USD$ and Bitcoin, and decide whether a given trade might yield more $$ but lose value in bitcoin. Which trade would be more advantageous when it is time to take profits?

## Pain points to target:
* No need to actively monitor prices and trends, possibly letting emotions creep into decision making
* Determine cost basis of current positions, both for tax purposes and to know how well portfolio is doing

## Features:
* set up notifications for specified indicator conditions
* compare relative prices between a symbol, USD$, and Bitcoin
* report cost basis
