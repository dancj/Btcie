# Btcie
Process to monitor Bitcoin prices and notify me of buy/sell signals from certain indicators, such as bollinger bands and price momentum.

Also it is generally confusing to track altcoin prices in both USD$ and Bitcoin, and decide whether a given trade might yield more $$ but 
lose value in bitcoin. Which trade would be more advantageous when it is time to take profits?

## Features:
* set up notifications for specified indicator conditions
* compare relative prices between a symbol, USD$, and Bitcoin
